# saeko

sakeo is a very simple bare-bones PPM viewer. This project was developed as a tool while working through the development of my Rust Ray Tracer.

This project is written in Svelte.

## Developing

If you'd like to run this project locally, simply run the following commands.

```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production build, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
